@description
@This manual serves the purpose of giving the reader a basic introduction into
@how m4stack works, and acts as a place to explain certain concepts that m4stack
@uses.
@
@\M USING M4STACK
@One of the more inconvenient parts of using m4stack is its integration with
@\Bliberror\B(cware). You do not \Bneed\B to use liberror in m4stack, as if
@\BLIBERROR_ENABLED\B is not defined, it will not attempt to expand the safety
@check macros, like out of bounds checks.
@
@This being said, it is still recommended that you use them. So, if you do decide
@to use them, all you need to do is make sure that each file that uses m4stack
@has access to the liberror macros. I would suggest using a "central header" for
@your project, which includes all the other headers.
@
@Other than that, since m4stack is written in m4, you will need to have the m4
@preprocessor on your box. While you most likely do, it might be less work on
@the end of the user for you to \Bpreprocess\B your C code  with m4 before
@shipping it. Otherwise, you can preprocess it while building.
@
@\M PROPERTIES
@Explanations aside, the one truly defining feature of the \Bm4\B(1) data structure
@implementations is how they store information. The C-Ware data structures, along with
@m4stack, use a namespacing system with other macros to hold information about a given
@data structure. Most of the m4stack operations will take a \Inamespace\I argument,
@which is used to access information about that data structure. As an example, say you
@had an stack of heap-allocated strings, which should all be released from memory when
@the stack is released. If we wanted to \Binitialize\B, and \Bfree\B the stack, we would
@need to define a collections of macros which end in the suffixes \B_TYPE\B, \B_NAME\B,
@and \B_FREE\B respectively.
@
@define(`STRING_STACK_TYPE', `char *')\N
@define(`STRING_STACK_NAME', `struct StringStack')\N
@define(`STRING_STACK_FREE', `free($1)')\N
@
@In this case, \ISTRING_STACK\I is our namespace. Any macro which might need access to this
@information can just be passed the namespace as an argument, and be on its way. This is how
@all the operations in m4stack access external information, if they need it. That being said,
@these macros are for each \Btype\B of data structure. If you wanted to instantiate multiple
@stacks of strings, you can use the same namespace. You only need to use other namespaces if
@you are working with other types, and can easily just switch out the namespace for other types
@if needed.
@
@The information stored in macros are usually referred to as data structure properties, or
@just properties. Here is a list of each property, and a description of it. Do note, you
@do not need to define \Ievery\I macro-- only the ones you need to use. If you use an
@operation, check the notes section of its manual page for what macros it uses.
@
@\B_TYPE\B\N
@\R 0.4
@This property stores the type of data stored in the stack. For example, if you wanted
@to store an stack of pointers to integers, \Bint *\B would be stored. Or, if you wanted
@an stack of structures named \BMyStruct\B, you could have the type of \Bstruct MyStruct\B.
@\R
@
@\B_NAME\B\N
@\R 0.4
@This property stores the type of the stack. For example, if you had an stack structure
@declared as \BMyArray\B, you would set this property to \Bstruct MyArray\B, or if it was
@declared with a typedef, just \BMyArray\B.
@\R
@
@\B_FREE\B
@\R 0.4
@This property is a 'callback' macro that describes how an element of the stack should be
@released from memory. The first argument is the value to release from memory. For example,
@if you had an stack of heap-allocated strings, and you wanted to to release them from memory,
@you could define the stack as \Bfree($1)\B, which will invoke the \Bfree\B(3) function over
@an element of the stack.
@\R
@
@\M COMPILATION NOTES
@Some of the operating systems that m4stack will compile under need a specific macro
@defined for the code to be compiled correctly on that operating system. If you are
@targeting any of the following operating systems, please define the corresponding
@macro to make sure m4stack knows what operating system it is on.
